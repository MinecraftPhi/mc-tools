# MC Pack Tools

This website is a collection of tools to make developing datapacks and resource packs for Minecraft easier.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

Pushes to the `master` branch of the main repository will trigger an automatic build of the website using github actions. The built site is in the branch `gh_pages` and should never be committed or pushed to manually.
